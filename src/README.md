# COSC620

Project 1 - Poly.java

This program will take an input file, and read line by line differentiating the powers and
 * coefficients of f(x) and g(x).  It outputs the addition, subtraction, and multiplication
 * of the polynomials in a file, 'output.txt.'


Project 2 - GF1.java

This project implements the first type of finite field Zp, and four operations
 * “+”, “-”, “*”, and “/”, respectively. Specifically, this program will read a modulus p and
 * two elements x and y from a file named “input.txt”. Then the program will create a file
 * named “output.txt” and write the results to “output.txt”.
